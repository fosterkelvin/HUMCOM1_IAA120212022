        <h1><u>The Da Vinci Code</u></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <u>The Da Vinci Code</u> follows "symbologist" <u>Robert Langdon</u> and cryptologist <u>Sophie Neveu</u> after a murder in the Louvre Museum in Paris causes them to become involved in a battle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of <u>Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene</u> having a child together. This is one of the <i><b style="color:red;">best</b></i> book for me.
